This is a fascinating project that demonstrates the evolution from simple polling to a full async runtime for embedded systems! Let me walk you through the key insights by examining how each stage builds upon the previous one, and then connect these concepts to the broader async ecosystem including `futures` and Embassy.

## The Journey from Polling to Async

### Stage 1: Timer Interrupts (poll_from_timer)

The journey begins with the simplest approach - using timer interrupts to blink an LED. This establishes the foundation: we configure a hardware timer (TIM2) to generate interrupts at 1kHz, incrementing a counter. The main loop polls this counter and toggles the LED every 1000 counts (1 second).

This approach has a critical limitation: the CPU constantly checks the counter value, wasting energy. The `wfi()` (wait for interrupt) instruction helps, but we still wake up 1000 times per second even though we only need to act once per second.

### Stage 2: Polling Tasks (polling_tasks)

The second stage introduces several key abstractions that move us toward async programming:

1. **Tasks**: Instead of inline code, we have `ButtonTask` and `LedTask` that encapsulate state and behavior
2. **Channels**: A communication mechanism between tasks (the button sends events to the LED)
3. **Timers with state**: The `TickTimer` tracks when delays expire

The main loop now polls multiple tasks:
```rust
loop {
    button_task.poll();
    led_task.poll();
}
```

This is better organized but still inefficient - we're polling constantly even when nothing needs to happen.

### Stage 3: Custom Future Implementation (our_future)

Here's where things get really interesting! This stage implements a custom `Future` trait that mirrors Rust's standard `Future`:

```rust
pub trait OurFuture {
    type Output;
    fn poll(&mut self, task_id: usize) -> Poll<Self::Output>;
}
```

The key insight is that futures can return `Poll::Pending` when they're not ready, allowing the executor to sleep until something actually needs attention. The system now uses:

1. **Wake mechanisms**: When a timer expires or button is pressed, the interrupt handler calls `wake_task()`
2. **Task queue**: Woken tasks are queued for execution
3. **Efficient sleeping**: The executor sleeps when no tasks are ready

The timer implementation showcases on-demand scheduling - instead of periodic interrupts, we program the timer to interrupt exactly when the next deadline arrives. This is a massive efficiency improvement!

### Stage 4: Standard Rust Futures (rust_future)

The final stage adapts everything to use Rust's standard `Future` trait and async/await syntax. The custom executor now provides proper `Waker` and `Context` types:

```rust
impl Future for TickTimer {
    type Output = ();
    
    fn poll(mut self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Self::Output> {
        // Can access the waker from context
        cx.waker().task_id()
    }
}
```

## Key Async Runtime Concepts

Looking at this progression, we can identify the essential components of an async runtime:

### 1. The Future Trait
A future represents a value that may not be ready yet. When polled, it either returns `Ready(value)` or `Pending`. This is the foundation of cooperative multitasking - futures voluntarily yield control when they can't make progress.

### 2. The Waker System
When a future returns `Pending`, it must arrange to be woken when it can make progress. This project implements wakers as task IDs, but the standard library uses a more sophisticated vtable-based approach that allows any executor to provide its own wake implementation.

### 3. The Executor
The executor is the runtime that actually drives futures to completion. This project's executor:
- Maintains a queue of ready tasks
- Polls ready tasks until they return `Pending`
- Sleeps when no tasks are ready
- Wakes when interrupts signal task readiness

### 4. Leaf Futures
These are the futures that actually interact with hardware. In this project:
- `TickTimer` interacts with the timer hardware
- `InputChannel` interacts with GPIO interrupts
- `Channel` provides inter-task communication

## Connecting to futures and Embassy

### The futures Crate

The `futures` crate provides utilities for working with Rust's async ecosystem. In this project, we see `select_biased!` used to wait for multiple futures:

```rust
select_biased! {
    button_event = receiver.receive().fuse() => {
        // Handle button press
    }
    _ = ticker::delay(blinker.get_period()).fuse() => {
        // Timer expired
    }
}
```

This is more elegant than manually implementing state machines. The `futures` crate also provides:
- Stream traits for async iteration
- Sink traits for async writing
- Utilities like `join!` for concurrent execution
- Channel implementations for async communication

### Embassy Framework

Embassy takes these concepts even further by providing:

1. **Hardware Abstraction**: Embassy HALs wrap peripherals in async-friendly interfaces
2. **Integrated Executor**: Optimized for embedded systems with static task allocation
3. **Time Management**: Sophisticated timer queues similar to this project's approach
4. **Power Management**: Automatic sleep states when no tasks are ready

Embassy would simplify this blinky button example significantly:

```rust
#[embassy_executor::main]
async fn main(spawner: Spawner) {
    let p = embassy_stm32::init(Default::default());
    
    // Button task
    spawner.spawn(button_task(p.PC13.into())).unwrap();
    
    // LED task  
    spawner.spawn(led_task(p.PA5.into())).unwrap();
}

#[embassy_executor::task]
async fn led_task(mut led: Output<'_>) {
    loop {
        led.toggle();
        Timer::after(Duration::from_millis(500)).await;
    }
}
```

## The Power of Async for Embedded

The progression in this project beautifully illustrates why async is so powerful for embedded systems:

1. **Energy Efficiency**: Instead of busy-waiting, the CPU sleeps until precisely when work needs to be done
2. **Composability**: Complex behaviors emerge from simple, composable futures
3. **Resource Efficiency**: No thread stacks needed - just small state machines
4. **Deterministic Timing**: Hardware timers ensure precise timing without CPU involvement

The on-demand timer scheduling is particularly clever - by maintaining a priority queue of deadlines and programming the timer for the next expiration, the system achieves optimal efficiency. This is exactly the approach used by modern async runtimes like Embassy.

Understanding this progression from polling to async helps demystify what async runtimes actually do. They're not magic - they're carefully orchestrated systems that leverage hardware interrupts, state machines, and cooperative scheduling to achieve remarkable efficiency. This foundation will serve you well whether you're using Embassy for embedded development or Tokio for server applications!
